STEPS
Consolidate disconnect functions and put them in header!
categorify all files!

- double check flash messages, make sure they have appropriate string substitution
- move the category edit name to the category screen. Also create a delete category function/link, put it in the same place
-block against null entries. Maybe do it in javascript!
-maybe some kind of style switch on the category page to indicate that I've created a category?
- delete old google/facebook restaurant app and create new category oauth stuff.  Wait I just renamed it!??!
- for images just have blob url
-flask wtf features for https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
-maybe do it in python
-flask packages for moving oauth files to another py module

- if you get image attach working, put the URL in the JSON readers
- make latestaddition work in local time, and correct time that it's showing. it's showing the wrong time!
